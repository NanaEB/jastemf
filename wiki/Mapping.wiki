#summary Attribute Grammar Metamodel Mapping

= Introduction =
On this page, we discuss the general mapping between attribute grammars and metamodels. Afterwards, we present the technical details of the JastAdd-Ecore mapping.

== Options of Ecore features==
Each structural feature of an Ecore model's metaclasses can be configured by a bunch of options. Some of them even directly influence code generation.

||Option||Semantics in Ecore||Effect in JastEMF||
||derived||*true* the feature's value is meant to be _derived_ from other features||The feature is computed by an attribute||
||transient||*true* setters and getters have to be implemented manually in generated code|| ||
||volatile||*true*|| ||
||containment||*true* the feature belongs to the underlying containment hierarchy|| ||
||changeable||*true* the feature can be set manually|| ||
