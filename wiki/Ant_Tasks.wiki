= Basic User Interface =

Users interact with JastEMF in a black-box manner via a single Ant task. The complete integration process is started by calling the task and afterwards handled automatically by JastEMF.

The task is configurated with the generator model to use (`genmodel`), the package for the generated integration artefacts (`outpackage`), the package for the _JastAdd_ generated AST classes (`astpackage`), optional arguments for _JastAdd_ (`jastadd`) and arbitrary many filesets containing the semantic specifications. The optional arguments can be any option known by [http://jastadd.org/jastadd-reference-manual/running-jastadd-from-the-command-line JastAdd's command line interface] and are used to configure _JastAdd_ when internally called by JastEMF throughout the integration process.

{{{
<jastemf
    genmodel="path/to/the/ecore/generator/model/to/use/modelname.genmodel"
    outpackage="package.for.the.integration.artifacts.generated.by.jastemf"
    astpackage="package.for.the.ast.classes.generated.by.jastadd"

        <include name="**/*.jrag"/>
        <include name="**/*.jadd"/>
    </fileset>
</jastemf>
}}}

The embedded _JastAdd_ call has not to specify the AST classes' package and output directory again. Also the `--rewrite` flag is always set by JastEMF.
