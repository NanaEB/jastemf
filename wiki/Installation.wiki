= JastEMF Requirements =

JastEMF requires the _[http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/ Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)]_ for _Ecore_ metamodel handling and _[http://www.openarchitectureware.org/ openArchitectureware]_ to execute integration artefacts generating templates. The easiest way to satisfy all requirements of JastEMF is to deploy it as plugin in a ([http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ fresh installed]) Eclipse 3.5 modelling distribution.

In detail JastEMF requires at least:
  * Apache Ant version 1.7 or higher
  * Eclipse version 3.5 or higher with installed
  * EMF SDK version 2.5 or higher (Update site http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/updates/releases/) and
  * Modelling Weaving Engine (including _xTend_ and _xPand_) version 0.7.2 or higher

= Installing JastEMF =

  # Download and install Eclipse 3.5 Modelling distribibution to an arbitrary directory _DIR_ with write access.  
  # Download the most recent _org.jastemf_ plugin JAR from this webpage's [http://code.google.com/p/jastemf/downloads/list download] section and move it to the eclipse dropins directory (_DIR_/dropins).
  # Optionally download the most recent _org.jastemf.converter_ plugin JAR from this webpage's [http://code.google.com/p/jastemf/downloads/list download] section and move it to _DIR_/dropins.
  # Run Eclipse and select an arbitrary workspace. Check if all JastEMF ANT tasks have been properly registered to Eclipse by investigating _Preferences => Ant => Runtime =>_ Tab _Tasks_. You should find the `jastemf` task and, if you installed the converter, the `jastemf.ecore2ast` and `jastemf.ecore2jrag` tasks.

= Quickstart with the SIPLE Example =

A good starting point for learning how to use JastEMF is to investigate the [Examples SIPLE example] (Simple Imperative Programming Language Example). To build and run it you first need to install JastEMF as described above. Afterwards, SIPLE can be checked out from JastEMF's SVN repository under _"jastemf-examples/calculator"_. For further instructions consult the [Examples example's web page].

= Troubleshooting =

If you cannot find the Ant tasks, make sure you installed the correct Eclipse version and distribution and that you do not have an out-dated or multiple Ant version(s) installed. If everything seems right, try starting Eclipse with the -clean commandline option. If this still does not work, please report us your issue with detailled information.
