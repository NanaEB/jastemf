#summary Developer Documentation for Statemachine Example Language

= Introduction to Statemachine Language =

The Statemachinelanguage is a language to describe the behaviour of systems using a state-based abstraction. It uses a graphical syntax that was built using the Graphical Modeling Framework [http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/gmf/ GMF].


= Deployment and Configuration =

== Requirements ==
To work with the Statemachine language you need to install JastEMF. Please follow the [Installation] guide.
== Installation ==

The Statemachine language can be checked out from the project's SVN repository. It is eclipse project named _"statemachine"_ and a subfolder of _"jastemf-examples"_. You should check it out with your favourite SVN client. 

If not already imported with eclipse you need to import the project into you Eclipse Workspace (File > Import... > Existing Projects into Workspace)

== Configuration ==

After deploying the Statemachine language to your Eclipse workspace you can start the build process. We provide a buildscript that runs the JastEMF generator. The build script must be executed within the same JRE as Eclipse. Therefore, select _Run > External Tools > External Tool Configurations..._ and create a new Ant Build. As _Buildfile_ select _/statemachine/specifications/build.xml_. Now switch to the configuration tab _JRE_ and activate the option _Run in the same JRE as the workspace_. In the _Targets_ tab  check that the target _EMF Semantic [default]_ is activated. Finally you select _Run_ and the JastEMF code generation should be executed.
