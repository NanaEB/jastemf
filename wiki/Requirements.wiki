= Basic Requirements for using JastEMF =
The easiest way to resolve all requirements of JastEMF is just downloading and installing a fresh Eclipse 3.5 modelling distribution from http://www.eclipse.org.

If you want to use JastEMF in an exisiting Eclipse installation your distribution's version should be at least 3.5 . The following plugins need to be installed:
  * Eclipse Modelling Framework >= 2.5
  * Modelling Weaving Engine (including languages xTend and xPand) >= 0.7.2 
  * Apache ANT
