= Basic Requirements for using JastEMF =
The easiest way to resolve all requirements of JastEMF is just downloading and installing a fresh Eclipse 3.5 modelling distribution from http://www.eclipse.org.

If you want to use JastEMF in an exisiting Eclipse installation your distribution's version should be at least 3.5 . The following plugins need to be installed:
  * Eclipse Modelling Framework >= 2.5
  * Modelling Weaving Engine (including languages xTend and xPand) >= 0.7.2 
  * Apache ANT 

= Installing JastEMF =

  # Download and install Eclipse 3.5 Modelling distribibution to an arbitrary directory d with write access.  
  # Download the most recent org.jastemf plugin JAR from this webpage's [http://code.google.com/p/jastemf/downloads/list download] section and move it to the eclipse dropins directory (d/dropins).
  # Optionally download the most recent org.jastemf.converter plugin JAR from this webpage's [http://code.google.com/p/jastemf/downloads/list download] section and move it to d/dropins.
  # Run Eclipse and select an arbitrary workspace. Check if all JastEMF ANT tasks have been properly registered to Eclipse by investigating Preferences -> Ant -> Runtime -> Tab Tasks. You should find the jastemf task and, if you installed the converter, the jastemf.ecore2ast and jastemf.ecore2jrag tasks. If you cannot find them, check that you installed the correct  Eclipse version and distribution, that you do not have an out-dated or multiple Ant version(s) installed. If everything seems right, try starting Eclipse with the -clean commandline option. If this still does not work, please report your issue with detailled information to us.
