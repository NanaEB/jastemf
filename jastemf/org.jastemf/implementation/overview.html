<b><h2>Overview and Application Domain</h2></b>
<i>JastEMF</i> is a tool to support the integrated use of the <i>JastAdd</i>
system -- a <i>rewriteable, circular, reference attribute grammar (ReCRAG)</i>
generator -- and the <i>Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)</i> -- a <i>Java</i>
based metamodeling framework build around the <i>ECore</i> metamodeling
language. The objective of <i>JastEMF</i> is to permit the specification of an
<i>ECore</i> metamodel's semantics using a <i>JastAdd</i> <i>ReCRAG</i>. Given
an <i>ECore</i> metamodel and an <a href="#integration_project_requirements">
appropriate</a> <i>JastAdd</i> abstract syntax tree (AST) the metamodel's
semantics -- i.e. the value and behavior of its derived attributes,
non-containment references and operations -- can be specified using
<i>JastAdd</i>. In essence, <i>JastAdd</i> can be used to <b>define</b> the
metamodel elements that are only <b>declared</b> in the metamodel.
<p>
<i>JastEMF</i> has three main use-cases, summarized in Figure I:
<ul>
	<li>Given a metamodel one likes to specify its semantics, i.e. implement
	the evaluation and resolution routines for some or all of its derived
	attributes, non-containment references and operations.</li>
	<li>Given a metamodel one likes to build a tool that somehow reasons about
	model instances, e.g. to produce some model dependent output or to
	manipulate the model.</li>
	<li>Given a <i>JastAdd</i> compiler one likes to integrate it into the
	<i>EMF</i> world, i.e. provide the compiler internal API for other
	<i>EMF</i> based tools by supporting a metamodel for the compiler.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>
For convenient reasons we will call the first two use-cases the specification
of metamodel semantics and the last use-case a <i>JastAdd</i> evaluator
adaptation against the <i>EMF</i>. Since <i>JastEMF's</i> integration process
is equal for all its use-cases, we will in the following just speak about the
specification of metamodel semantics.

<a name="definition_metamodel_semantics"><h2>Metamodels, ReCRAGs and Metamodel Semantics</h2></a>

<b>Definition <i>(Metamodel Semantic)</i>:</b> Let <i>MM</i> be a metamodel
and <i>MME(MM)</i> be the finite set of its elements. Let <i>MME_syntax(MM)</i>
and <i> MME_semantic(MM)</i> be disjunct subsets of <i>MME(MM)</i>, whereas <i>MME(MM) =
MME_syntax(MM) + MME_semantic(MM)</i>. Let <i>ME(M)</i> be the set of entities of a
model instance <i>M\MM</i>. Since <i>M\MM</i>, all
entities <i>e\ME(M)</i> have a type <i>t(e)\MME(MM)</i>. Let <i>S(MM)</i> be a function that
defines for all <i>M\MM</i> for
each entity <i>e\ME(M)</i> with <i>t(e)\E_semantic(MM)</i> the value of <i>e</i>.
We call <i>S(MM)</i> a metamodel semantic for <i>MM</i>.
<p>
A metamodel semantic defines -- based on the metamodel -- for any model instance
the values of model entities of certain types. Usually, the specification is based
on arbitrary other model entities and their values. We call the entities
defined semantic entities and the specification of their values semantic
specification. To specify the existence of semantic entities we call a
declaration and say the entity is declared.

If the semantic specification for a semantic construct is known,
we say the construct is defined. Consequently, any defined semantic construct
is also declared, but not necessary vice-versa. With metamodel semantics we
mean declaration

<h2>Integration Projects</h2>

Starting point for <i>JastEMF</i> is a project containing an <i>ECore</i>
metamodel -- represented by a generator model (GenModel) -- and arbitrary many
<i>JastAdd</i> <i>ReCRAG</i> specifications for its semantics. As context-free
structure for the <i>ReCRAG</i> specifications -- i.e. the AST the project's
<i>rewriteable, circular, reference, attribute grammar</i> is based on -- the
metamodel's non-containment references are used. <a
name="integration_project_requirements"> Thus, <b>the <i>ReCRAG's</i> AST must
be isomorph to the metamodel's non-containment reference graph</b>.</a>
<br>
We call a project satisfying these conditions an integration project. Using
only <i>EMF</i> tools and <i>JastAdd</i> a developer can generate an <i>EMF</i>
implementation for the metamodel and a <i>JastAdd</i> evaluator for the
<i>ReCRAG</i>, but he cannot use the evaluator to reason about model instances.
Both, the metamodel and the evaluator, have absolutely no knowledge about each
other. Even worse, the evaluator maintains its own AST repository and the model
has only method skeletons for its <a href="#definition_metamodel_semantics">
semantics</a>. However, if <i>JastEMF</i> is used
to steer the model and evaluator generation -- i.e. to call <i>EMF</i> and
<i>JastAdd</i> throughout its execution -- the result would be an <i>EMF</i>
model whose semantic methods are implemented. The integrated project has the
API of the metamodel and the semantics of the evaluator. Additionally,
<i>JastEMF</i> produces a tightly integration. With tightly, we mean that the
result is one class hierarchy. The evaluator is woven into the <i>EMF</i>
model. There is no need for adapters from the evaluator to the model or vice
versa. In fact, <i>JastAdd's</i> internal AST repository (non-terminals and
terminals) is completely deleted and instead the model repository is used, such
that <i>EMF's</i> model manipulation semantics -- notifications, interfaces
etc. -- are satisfied. On the other hand, any semantic constructs within the
model are deleted from the model's implementation and instead the ones
generated by <i>JastAdd</i> are used. In the end, both, repository and
semantics, are integrated within the same classes -- thus, it is a tightly
integration.

<h2>Integration Process</h2>

The complete integration process is observed and steered by an {@link
org.jastemf.IntegrationManager integration manager}, which is responsible to
interact with <i>JastAdd</i>, the <i>EMF</i> and the components that generate
integration related artefacts like <a href="#refactoring_scripts">refactoring
scripts</a> or <a href="#repository_adaptations">repository adaptations</a>.
The following figure summarizes <i>JastEMF's</i> integration process:

<br><b>Fig. II:</b> <i>JastEMF's</i> Integration Process

It consists of three phases. Starting from the project to integrate,
<b>phase I</b> generates based on the generator model a <i>JastAdd</i>
specification that weaves methods ... TODO

<h2>User Interface</h2>

The user has not to be aware of the integration process. For him <i>JastEMF</i>
is a black-box he can call using an {@link org.jastemf.ant.JastemfTask
<i>Ant</i> task}. The task is configurated with the generator model to use, the
package for the generated integration artefacts, the package for the
<i>JastAdd</i> generated AST classes and an embedded call to <i>JastAdd's</i>
own <i>Ant</i> task, such that it is no problem to configurate <i>JastAdd</i>
as used to. Of course, the embedded <i>JastAdd</i> call has not to specify the
AST classes' package and output directory again.
