This folder contains all AspectJ specifications and Java source code files
required to prepare the Calculator for semantic regression tests with RTT.
Two possible adaptation scenarios exist:
 - For the basic Calculator (generated by JastAdd)
 - For the EMF compatible Calculator (generated by JastAdd and adapted to
   the EMF by JastEMF) Beware, the required adaptations for RTT have to be
   delayed until JastEMF has been executed.
